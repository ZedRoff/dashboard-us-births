The most populous states, such as Texas (TX) and California (CA), are marked in dark red, indicating a very high number of births (likely above 400k). Florida (FL) and New York (NY) also have darker shades, reflecting significant birth numbers. On the other hand, states like Wyoming (WY), South Dakota (SD), Vermont (VT), and Alaska (AK) appear in light beige, suggesting much lower birth numbers, likely below 50k. Geographically, densely populated states on the East and West coasts tend to have higher birth numbers, while less populated states in the Midwest and Rocky Mountains show lower figures.")

In 2016, births were around 4 million, but by 2020, the number had fallen to approximately 3.5 million. However, in 2021, there was a slight recovery, suggesting a potential shift in demographic behavior or social conditions, such as post-pandemic effects or birth rate support policies. This decline could be linked to a broader global trend of decreasing birth rates, economic impacts like the late-2010s crisis, and sociocultural shifts, such as the delay in having the first child. The small increase in 2021 deserves further analysis, as it might reflect a recovery after the pandemic.")
