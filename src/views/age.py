                           for motherhood in many socio-economic contexts.
                           Other significant ranges include [30, 32] with 
                           4,789,040 births and [28, 30] with 4,298,360,

                           dominant range but still notable. Lower birth

                           births and [32, 34] with 3,540,036, reflecting 
                           a decline in births as age increases. The extremes,
                           [22, 24] and [34, 36], show the fewest births, indicating
                           that women at these ages either delay motherhood for personal
                           or career reasons or face fertility challenges.
                           This suggests that the optimal period for childbirth is between 26 and 32 years,
                           with younger women deferring motherhood for education or career, 
                           and older women experiencing a decrease in fertility
                           or having already started families.''')
